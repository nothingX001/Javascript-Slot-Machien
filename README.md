# Slot Machine



## Overview

This is a simple command-line game implemented in JavaScript. The game simulates a basic slot machine where players can place bets, spin the reels, and potentially win based on the outcome. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for creating an interactive console-based application.



## Features

1. User Interaction: The game interacts with users through the command line, allowing them to place bets and spin the slot machine.
2. Randomized Outcomes: The slot machine results are randomized, providing a fair chance of winning.
3. Betting System: Players can bet a specified amount and win based on the symbols that appear on the reels.
4. Simple Design: The project is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand.



## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install the dependencies by running the following command:

2. Copy code
3. npm install



## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the slot machine game by executing the following command:
